# Berkeley_Lightcurves

**What is this script about?**
This script is vital in work regarding SETI. This script can plot lightcurves. We can track abnormalities in the light curve to potentially identify exoplanets(potential homes to ETs).

**What is this script for myself and others in the future?**
This script will help us to identify exoplanets based on abornmalities in a star's light curve.
This script is vital for an aspiring SETI astrophysicist. Exoplanets can be studied and we can measure the ability for them to support life. We could even identify life on exoplanets that have been discovered.
